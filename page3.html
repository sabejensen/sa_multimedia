      The film went on to break the Japanese box office record, beating the previous
      holder, "Titanic."" It was the most successful film that Studio
      Ghibli ever produced. It became the first film ever to gross over 200 million
      dollars before a US release. 
      <br><br>
      Disney agreed to produce an English release at the request of Pixar's 
      John Lasseter. But in response to Studio Ghibli retaining merchandising rights,
      Disney put relatively little into marketting the film.
      <br><br>
      After a great critical response, including 4 stars from critic Roger Ebert, 
      and winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, the movie saw more box
      office success, eventually getting 10 million in the US and 365 million worldwide
      to date.
