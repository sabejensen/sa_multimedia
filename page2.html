    <p>Hayao Miyazaki was already a well established and retired filmmaker when he decided
      to make Spirited Away. He decided while on a family trip while observing several young
      girls who were friends of the family that he needed to make a film for 10-year-old girls.
      He read the magazines that the girls read at the cabin and saw they were all about crushes
      and romance, but he decided this wasn't what they "held dear in their hearts." He opted
      to make a movie with a young girl going on a heroic, transformative journey instead.
      <br><br>
      He based the setting around a bathhouse from his hometown. Production of the film
      began with a budget of 15 million dollars. A substantial portion was provided by 
      Disney, who in exchange got right of first refusal for the US release of the film.
      The film plays heavily with Shinto-Budhist lore. The protagonist, Chihiro, encounters
      spirits and gods representing several real world plants and animals. Several of the
      ideas in the film have their roots in Japanese folklore.
